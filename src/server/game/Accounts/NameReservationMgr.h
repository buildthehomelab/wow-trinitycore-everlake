//
// auth.name_reservation holds one row per name (the core's normalised form, "Ora"): the owning Battle.net account,
// the surname, the realm and character that used it last, when it was reserved and when it was freed.
// auth.name_reservation_character lists every character on every realm that uses a name now.
//
// Character create, rename, customize, faction change, undelete and dump load call Reserve() before the character
// takes the name, then Attach() once it is saved (or Rollback() if it failed). Deleting a character calls Release():
// once no character on any realm uses the name, freed_at is set and other accounts may take it after the grace
// period (NameReservation.GracePeriod). Bots never reserve; see SetYieldHandler and docker/patches/playerbot/.
